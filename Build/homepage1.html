            <h2><b><ins>Rules and Regulations for Table Tennis</ins></b></h2>
        <p>
            The game of table tennis, governed by the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF), follows a set of structured rules. Here are some of the key regulations that all players should be familiar with:
            <ol type="1">
            <li><b>The Table and Equipment:</b></li>

            <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                <li>The table must be 2.74 meters long, 1.525 meters wide, and 76 centimeters above the ground.</li>
                <li>The net should be positioned at the center and extend 15.25 centimeters above the surface.</li>
                <li>The ball should weigh 2.7 grams and have a diameter of 40 mm.</li>
            </ul>

            <li><b>Scoring:</b></li>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                <li>A match is played to the best of five or seven games.</li>
                <li>Each game is won by the first player or team to reach 11 points, provided they lead by at least two points. If both players reach 10 points, the game continues until one player achieves a two-point lead.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <li><b>Serving:</b></li>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                <li> The serve must start with the ball resting on an open palm, thrown vertically at least 16 cm in the air.</li>
                <li>The server must strike the ball behind the end line and allow it to bounce once on each side of the net.</li>
                <li>Each player serves twice in a row; after that, service alternates unless the score reaches 10-10, at which point each player serves only once in turn.
                </li>
            </ul>
           
            
            <li><b>Gameplay:</b></li>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                <li>Players must return the ball over the net, ensuring it bounces only once on the opponent's side.</li>
                <li>A point is scored when the opponent fails to make a valid return, allowing the ball to bounce twice on their side, or hits it off the table without a valid return.</li>    
            </ul>
            
            <li><b>Let Serves:</b></li>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li>
                A "let" serve is called if the ball hits the net but still lands correctly on the opponent's side. This does not count as a serve, and the server must redo it.
            </li></ul>
            

            <li><b>Winning the Match:</b></li>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                <li>The player who wins the most games (best of five or seven) wins the match.</li>
            </ul>
            

            <li><b>Code of Conduct:</b></li>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                <li>Players must observe fair play and respect their opponents and the referees.</li>
                <li> In the case of any rule-breaking or unsportsmanlike conduct, the referee may issue warnings, award points to the opponent, or, in severe cases, disqualify the player.</li>
            </ul>
